# Coach Guide: Challenge 01 â€“ Mission Brief

## Purpose

This guide supports coaches in facilitating Challenge 01, helping students understand the business case and document key requirements for identity, network, database, and application security.

---

## Learning Outcomes

- Students analyze a real-world business scenario and extract security requirements.
- Students distinguish between current gaps and future needs.
- Students prioritize compliance and user experience in their documentation.
- Students practice structured documentation using tables and references.

---

## Facilitation Tips

- Encourage students to read the [IFS Customer Story](https://jonathan-vella.github.io/xlr8-e2eaisolutions/customer-story/) thoroughly before starting.
- Guide students to use the requirements table format and to be specific in their entries.
- Remind students to address both current gaps and future needs for each area.
- Prompt students to justify requirements with references to the business case or best practices.
- Emphasize the importance of compliance and user experience as business priorities.
- Suggest students use external resources for inspiration (e.g., Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework).

---

## Common Pitfalls

- Overlooking one or more security areas (identity, network, database, application).
- Focusing only on current gaps or only on future needs, instead of both.
- Failing to connect requirements to business priorities (compliance, user experience).
- Providing vague or generic requirements without justification.
- Not using the table format for clarity.

---

## Coaching Prompts

- "How does this requirement support the business goals described in the customer story?"
- "What compliance or user experience considerations are relevant here?"
- "Can you identify both a current gap and a future need for this area?"
- "What reference or best practice supports your requirement?"
- "Is your documentation clear and easy to follow for others?"

**Coach Tip:**
Encourage students to ask "why" for each requirement. This builds critical thinking and sets the stage for effective security design in later challenges.
