# Challenge 04 Coach Guide: Facilitating Adaptive Threat Response
## Purpose
Support students in developing a practical incident response playbook for SAIF, ensuring coverage of all key steps, justifications, and alignment with Microsoft best practices.

## Facilitation Steps

1. **Kickoff Discussion**
   - Review the attack scenario and business impact with students.
   - Emphasize the importance of adaptive, actionable incident response.

2. **Prompt Research and Planning**
   - Encourage students to explore attack guidance and Microsoft documentation.
   - Ask probing questions: “How do you detect threats in cloud environments?”, “Why is containment critical?”

3. **Guide Playbook Creation**
   - Ensure playbooks cover detection, containment, eradication, recovery, communication, and post-incident review.
   - Check that each step is accompanied by a written justification.
   - Remind students to reference best practices and documentation.

4. **Review and Feedback**
   - Use the scoring rubric to assess completeness, clarity, and alignment to best practices.
   - Provide feedback on missing steps, vague justifications, or unclear protocols.
   - Encourage actionable, easy-to-follow playbooks.

## Common Pitfalls

- Playbooks missing key steps (e.g., communication, post-incident review).
- Justifications that simply restate the step (“Containment stops the attack”) instead of explaining its business/security value.
- Lack of references to Microsoft documentation or best practices.
- Overly complex or generic playbooks that are not actionable.

## Example Prompts

- “Explain why rapid detection is important for SAIF.”
- “How does your containment strategy minimize business impact?”
- “What communication protocols are in place, and why?”
- “How will you improve the response process after an incident?”

## Scoring Rubric (for reference)

| Coverage of Response Steps      | All steps addressed and detailed | Most steps covered, some details missing | Major steps missing or vague |
| Written Justification           | Each step clearly justified | Most steps justified | Few/no justifications |
| Use of References               | Multiple relevant references included | Some references | No references |
| Communication Protocols         | Clear, actionable protocols included | Mentioned but not explained | Not addressed |
| Post-Incident Review            | Review and improvement steps included | Mentioned but not explained | Not addressed |
| Format & Clarity                | Playbook is clear, organized, easy to follow | Present but could be improved | Missing or unclear |

**Coach Tip:**
Focus feedback on the “why” behind each response step and how the playbook supports business priorities, compliance, and user trust.
