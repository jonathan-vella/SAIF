# Coach Guide: Challenge 02 â€“ Guardians of Access

## Purpose

This guide supports coaches in facilitating Challenge 02, helping students design a high-level remediation plan for identity security in the IFS business case.

---

## Learning Outcomes

- Students identify and address critical identity security areas without being given direct answers.
- Students distinguish between current gaps and future needs in identity security.
- Students prioritize compliance and user experience in their remediation plans.
- Students practice structured documentation using tables and references.

---

## Facilitation Tips

- Encourage students to carefully review the [IFS Customer Story](https://jonathan-vella.github.io/xlr8-e2eaisolutions/customer-story/) and related references.
- Guide students to interpret the prompts and discover the four key identity areas (access policies, privileged/emergency access, workload authentication, database identity integration) on their own.
- Remind students to address both current gaps and future needs for each area.
- Prompt students to justify their proposed solutions with references to best practices or documentation.
- Emphasize the importance of compliance and user experience as business priorities.
- Suggest students use external resources for inspiration (e.g., Conditional Access Overview, Entra ID docs).

---

## Common Pitfalls

- Focusing only on technical controls without considering business priorities.
- Overlooking one or more critical identity areas.
- Providing vague or generic solutions without justification.
- Not using the table format for clarity.
- Failing to include references.

---

## Coaching Prompts

- "What policies or controls could help ensure only the right users, under the right conditions, can access resources?"
- "How would you safeguard both privileged and emergency access?"
- "How can applications and workloads securely authenticate to Azure services?"
- "What options exist for integrating database authentication with enterprise identity?"
- "How does your solution support compliance and user experience?"
- "What reference or best practice supports your solution?"
- "Is your documentation clear and actionable for others?"

**Coach Tip:**
Encourage students to ask "why" for each solution. This builds critical thinking and sets the stage for effective security design in later challenges.
