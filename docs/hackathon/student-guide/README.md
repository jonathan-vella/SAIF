Each challenge builds on the previous, guiding you through the design, deployment, and security hardening of a modern cloud application.

## Prerequisites
- Azure account with sufficient permissions (Subscription Owner recommended)
- Access to the SAIF repository and all challenge guides
- Familiarity with Azure Portal, CLI, and basic networking concepts
- Tools: PowerShell, Docker, VS Code (recommended)
- Basic understanding of web application security principles
