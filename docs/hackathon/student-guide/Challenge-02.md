# Challenge 02: Guardians of Access – Designing the Identity Fortress

## Objective

Develop a high-level remediation plan to address identity security gaps for the IFS business case.

## Scenario

You are tasked with strengthening identity security for SAIF. This is a design challenge—focus on planning, not building.

## Instructions

1. **Review the Business Case**
   - Reference [IFS Customer Story](https://jonathan-vella.github.io/xlr8-e2eaisolutions/customer-story/).

2. **Identify Critical Identity Security Areas**
   - Consider the following aspects as you build your plan:
     - What policies and controls can you implement to ensure only the right users, under the right conditions, can access cloud resources?
     - What safeguards should be in place for privileged and emergency access?
     - How can applications and workloads securely authenticate to Azure services?
     - What options exist for integrating cloud database authentication with enterprise identity?

3. **Document Your Remediation Plan**
   - Use a table to outline each area you identify:
     - Description
     - Current Gap
     - Proposed Solution
     - Business Priority (Compliance/User Experience)
     - Reference

## Success Criteria

- A clear, actionable remediation plan covering all critical identity security areas.
- Plan addresses both current gaps and future needs.
- Compliance and user experience are considered.
- References to best practices or documentation included.

Focus on “why” each solution is needed and how it supports business priorities.
