# Challenge 04: Baseline Network Deployment – Implementing Zero Trust Architecture
# Timeline & Milestones
| Suggested Duration | Recommended Milestones |
|--------------------|-----------------------|
| 2 hours            | Network deployed, security controls configured |

## Objective
Deploy the zero trust network you designed in Challenge 03, using Azure hub-and-spoke architecture and best practices for segmentation and security controls.

## Scenario

You are tasked with implementing the network blueprint for SAIF. The goal is to deploy a hub-and-spoke network in Azure, configure all required subnets, and apply security controls to support zero trust principles.

## Instructions

1. **Review Your Design**
   - Reference your Challenge 03 network diagram and justifications.

2. **Design and Deploy Your Network Architecture**
   - Based on your Challenge 03 blueprint, plan a hub-and-spoke network topology suitable for SAIF in Azure.
   - Determine how you will segment the network to support zero trust principles, including the use of multiple subnets for key security and application components.
   - Decide which network and security services should be placed in the hub and which in the spoke, justifying your choices.

3. **Implement Security Controls and Connectivity**
   - Establish secure connectivity between your hub and spoke networks using Azure-native features.
   - Select and configure appropriate security controls (e.g., firewalls, gateways, WAF, NSGs) for each subnet and document your rationale.
   - Link each control to the specific Current Gap it addresses and the Future Need (desired outcome).
   - Ensure your configuration supports segmentation, monitoring, and compliance requirements.
   - Document your network topology, security rules, and peering setup, explaining how each supports zero trust principles and business priorities.

4. **Document Your Deployment**
   - Submit screenshots or exported configuration files showing:
     - Network topology
     - Subnet and peering configuration
     - Security controls (firewall, NSGs, WAF)
   - Include a brief written summary explaining how your deployment supports zero trust principles and business priorities.

## Success Criteria

- Hub and Spoke networks deployed in Azure.
- Hub network contains Azure Firewall and VPN Gateway subnets.
- Spoke network contains WAF, Web Front End, API Layer, and Data Layer subnets.
- VNet peering configured between Hub and Spoke.
- Azure Firewall, VPN Gateway, and WAF deployed and configured.
- NSGs applied to all subnets with documented rules.
- Deployment is documented with screenshots/config files and a summary.

## Scoring Rubric

## Quality Checklist
- Hub & spoke components deployed per design intent.
- Each security control traced back to a documented Gap.
- Peering + routing behavior validated (not assumed).
- NSG/Firewall rules documented with purpose (least privilege rationale).
- Evidence (screenshots/config extracts) corresponds to described outcomes.

See consolidated checklist: [QUALITY-CHECKLIST](../QUALITY-CHECKLIST.md#challenge-04--network-deployment)

### Submission Artifacts
- Screenshots / config extracts (peering, NSGs, firewall)
- Deviation notes (if any)
- Summary paragraph tying deployment to design

| Criteria                        | Excellent (5) | Good (3) | Needs Improvement (1) |
|---------------------------------|---------------|----------|-----------------------|
| Network Topology                | Hub and Spoke fully implemented | Most components present | Major components missing |
| Subnet Configuration            | All subnets correctly configured | Most subnets present | Few/no subnets configured |
| Security Controls               | Firewall, WAF, NSGs fully configured | Some controls present | Controls missing or misconfigured |
| VNet Peering                    | Peering correctly set up | Peering present but incomplete | No peering |
| Documentation                   | Screenshots/configs and summary included | Partial documentation | No documentation |
| Zero Trust Alignment            | Deployment clearly supports zero trust | Some alignment | No alignment |

**Tip:**
When documenting, use a consistent pattern: Gap → Control → Outcome. This improves clarity and speeds review.
