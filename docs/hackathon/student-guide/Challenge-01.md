# Timeline & Milestones
| Suggested Duration | Recommended Milestones |
|--------------------|-----------------------|
| 1 hour             | Requirements defined, rubric reviewed |

## Objective

Understand the customer’s business case and document key requirements related to identity, network, database, and application security.

## Scenario

You are a security consultant for IFS, tasked with modernizing their AI-powered application (SAIF). Your first mission is to analyze the business context and identify critical requirements that will shape your security strategy.

## Instructions

1. **Review the Customer Story**
   - Read the business case at [IFS Customer Story](https://jonathan-vella.github.io/xlr8-e2eaisolutions/customer-story/).
   - Identify the main business goals, stakeholders, and operational constraints.

2. **Identify Key Requirements**
   - List requirements for:
     - **Identity** (e.g., user authentication, access control)
     - **Network** (e.g., connectivity, segmentation, perimeter security)
     - **Database** (e.g., data protection, access, backup)
     - **Application** (e.g., functionality, security, compliance)
   - For each area, document:
     - **Current Gaps**
     - **Future Needs**
     - **Business Priorities** (focus on compliance and user experience)

3. **Document Your Findings**
   - Use the table format below to organize requirements. Add rows as needed.
